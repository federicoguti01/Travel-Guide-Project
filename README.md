Geocoding is the process of taking an address or location and returning the latitude and longitude. 
This program geocodes a user input. Using these coordinates, our program can provide information to help the user make a travel decision.


## Description Of Algorithm:

Using Google's powerful [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview), this program is able to process any location on Earth, not just cities or countries.
Try "Eiffel Tower France" or "Great Wall of China"!
